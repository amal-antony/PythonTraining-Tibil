#Class Objects
'''
1.An Object is an instance of a Class.
2.A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.


An object consists of :

   1. State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
   2. Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
   3. Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

'''


#Declaring Objects
'''
1.Declaring Objects are also called instantiating a class
2.When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. 
3.All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. 
4.The values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. 
5.A single class may have any number of instances.

#Modify Object Properties
'''
Every object has properties associated with them. We can set or modify the objectâ€™s properties after object initialization 
by calling the property directly using the dot operator.

Obj.PROPERTY = value

    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name

        print("Fruit is", self.name, "and Color is", self.color)

# creating object of the class
obj = Fruit("Apple", "red")

# Modifying Object Properties
obj.name = "strawberry"

# calling the instance method using the object obj
obj.show()
# Output Fruit is strawberry and Color is red



#Delete object properties
'''
We can delete the object property by using the del keyword. After deleting it, if we try to access it, we will get an error.
