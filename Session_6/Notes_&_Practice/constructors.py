#Constructors in Python
'''
1.Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.
2.The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.
3.In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.
'''

#Syntax of constructor declaration :

def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor

#Types of constructors :
    '''

    1.Default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t accept any arguments.
    Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.

    2.Parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
    The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.

# An Exmaple of default constructor
print("\n\nDefault constructor\n")
class Person:

    # default constructor
    def __init__(self):
        self.person = "person"

    # a method for printing data members
    def print_Person(self):
        print(self.person)


# creating object of the class
obj = Person()

# calling the instance method using the object obj
obj.print_Person()


print("\n\nParameterized constructor\n")
#An Example for Parameterised Costructor
class Addition:
    first = 0
    second = 0
    answer = 0

    # parameterized constructor
    def __init__(self, f, s):
        self.first = f
        self.second = s

    def display(self):
        print("First number = " + str(self.first))
        print("Second number = " + str(self.second))
        print("Addition of two numbers = " + str(self.answer))

    def calculate(self):
        self.answer = self.first + self.second


# creating object of the class
# this will invoke parameterized constructor
print("Object created")
obj = Addition(1000, 2000)

print("\nBefore Addition")
obj.display()
# perform Addition

print("\nBefore Addition")
obj.calculate()

# display result
obj.display()
