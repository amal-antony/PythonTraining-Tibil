#What is Object Oriented Programming in Python
'''
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".
The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code,
in the form of methods (actions object can perform).

An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects.
Python programming language supports different programming approaches like functional programming, modular programming.
One of the popular approaches is object-oriented programming (OOP) to solve a programming problem is by creating objects
'''

#An object has the following two characteristics:
'''
    Attribute
    Behavior

For example, A Car is an object, as it has the following properties:

    name, price, color as attributes
    breaking, acceleration as behavior
'''



#Class Intro
'''
A class contains the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. 
Properties represent variables, and the methods represent actions. Hence class includes both variables and methods.

#Object Intro
'''
Object is an instance of a class. The physical existence of a class is nothing but an object. In other words, 
the object is an entity that has a state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, laptop, etc.
