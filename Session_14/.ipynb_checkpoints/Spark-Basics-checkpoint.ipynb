    "# What is Spark ?\n",
    "Founded by founder of Databricks in 2009<br>\n",
    "Apache manages all the open source tools Spark by 2010<br>\n",
    "The company Databricks was founded in 2013<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A lightning fast and real time processing framework written in Scala(JVM)<br>\n",
    "FOr Python interface Py4J library is used - Py4j converts Java code into Python or vice versa<br>\n",
    "### In memory computations- \n",
    "All data processed in harddisk in data nodes - data is read from harddisk , it goes to RAM , operations performed on it and goes back to harddisk<br>\n",
    "Entire data is read from harddisk not just portion that is required , so entire data is stored in RAM which makes computing easier<br>\n",
    "Data remains in RAM and only after entire operation is completed it is stored into harddisk<br>\n",
    "Decreases latency<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the case with Hadoop , It reads only requird data from harddisk and after operation store it back to harddisk . Every time before and after processing the data it is stored in harddisk whch causes latency<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lazy Excecution \n",
    "Whenever we apply some function to read the data ,it will not read the data until and unless we perform some operations on the data<br>\n",
    "Eg: pd.read_csv() it just store data to RAM , in case of Spark it dosnot perform like that it doesnt store data inside the RAM until we perfrom any operation on it \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Processing \n",
    "Distributing workloads to different loads and maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Processing vs \n",
    "Whenever all data is collected in one storage, then it performs analysis and produce the results<br>\n",
    "Mapreduce Supports <br>\n",
    "Support in Spark<br>\n",
    "### Real Time Processing\n",
    "When there is real time data , i.e data comes more frequently and has to be processed and produce results real-time<br>\n",
    "No support in Mapreduce this bu Spark does support<br>\n",
    "eg:Credit Cards online-Check must be done to make sure its genuine<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark leverages Apache Hadoop for both Storage and Processing . It uses HDFS for storage and it can run Spark Applications on YARN as well\n",
    "Spark can load data from disk , memory , and other storage Technologies such as Amazon S3,HDFS,HBase and Cassandra\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hadoop cannot be entirely compared with Spark and Hadoop is a complete Package . It has Computer Engine,Storage Engine and Resource Manager , Spark only has Compute Engine\n",
    "#### But MapReduce can be compared with Spark\n",
